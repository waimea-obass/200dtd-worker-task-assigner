# Project Requirements

## Identified Problem or Need

When trying to manage a complicated project such as building a house, it can become a disorganised mess very quickly because of the amount of different workers with different qualifications you have to hire in order to achieve a multitude of tasks. People can become confused as to what they should do and might end up doing tasks that were unwanted or they were not qualified or asked to do.


## End-User Requirements

My end users are people whose job it is to manage these workers and make sure they are all working on the correct tasks at the correct time and have the correct specialties in order to do so.


## Proposed Solution

I intend to create a system that makes this job simple. A website that the managers can use to assign workers to specific tasks and can visibly see the information about the workers such as their work ethic and qualifications, which they can take into account when assigning them to different tasks.

# Relevant Implications

## Functionality

I need the website to function how it is intended to. This means such as when adding a new task and information, it shows up in the correct columns and also that they can delete a finished task. 

### Relevance to the System

If the system did not function correctly then nobody would want to utilise it because it would be tedious and undesirable to use.

### Impact / Considerations

I will need to consider how the different tables show up and how adding and deleting tasks functions. 



## Usability

I need the website to be smooth and efficient to use, with the navigation being desirable.

### Relevance to the System

If the system is laggy or clunky then it will be undesirable to use

### Impact / Considerations

I will need to consider how smoothly the assimilation between the different web pages happens ie the click of a button.



## Accessibility

I need the website to be accessible to my end user.

### Relevance to the System

If the system was not accessible no body would want to/ use it

### Impact / Considerations

If the system is accessible then more people would want to utilise it.



## Aesthetic

I need to website to be aesthetically pleasing

### Relevance to the System

If it looked ugly then nobody would want to utilise my website.

### Impact / Considerations

I will take into account the colour scheme, font, background of the website and make it all of a similar, aesthetically pleasing scheme.
