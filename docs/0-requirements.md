# Project Requirements

## Identified Problem or Need

When trying to manage a complicated project such as building a house, it can become a disorganised mess very quickly because of the amount of different workers with different qualifications you have to hire in order to achieve a multitude of tasks. People can become confused as to what they should do and might end up doing tasks that were unwanted or they were not qualified or asked to do.


## End-User Requirements

My end users are people whose job it is to manage these workers and make sure they are all working on the correct tasks at the correct time and have the correct specialties in order to do so.


## Proposed Solution

I intend to create a system that makes this job simple. A website that the managers can use to assign workers to specific tasks and can visibly see the information about the workers such as their work ethic and qualifications, which they can take into account when assigning them to different tasks.
